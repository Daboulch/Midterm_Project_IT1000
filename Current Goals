### Current Goals

My main focus is finishing college and making sure I stay caught up with classes since its very easy to get distracted and lose motivation to do work when you are online.

My other goals would be to try out some new [hobbies](https://github.com/Daboulch/Midterm_Project_IT1000/blob/b83a5efc725a63d0016104360a1fcc5a9c972800/Hobbies) soon before I get more busy with school and eventually work.

**Some short term goals:**
1. Start working out
2. Read some books
3. Go out with friends more
