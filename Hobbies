My main hobby has been playing games.  
I've been playing games since I was a kid and I will most likely continue to play them for a long time since it is 
very easy to chill and play with friends.

A new hobby I want to try is snowboarding.  
I've wanted to go snowboarding for a long time but never really had the opportunity to actually do it. I'm hoping to try it this year but most likely next year.

Another hobby I want to try to get into is rock climbing.  
I went rock climbing about a year ago and it was extremely fun but it is also quite challenging and something that you can progress at over time.
